# Traffic-Analysis
Jupyter Notebook containing some EDA on traffic over a bridge.



In this notebook I had dataset of 4 years of everyday of every hour counting how many people used the bridge. The data was time series based data
most of the preprocessing I did in this notebook is based on time series data.

Data itself doesn't look good we have to do some processing to give us some insights using various visualizations.

I have some interesting visualizations for supporting my hypothesis.

And I have used some algorithms :


**1. Gaussian Mixture(For Clustering)**

**2. Principal Component Analysis(For Dimensionality Reduction)**
